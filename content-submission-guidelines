Here are some content guidelines (rules) for requesting a partner content release:

1. Anything you release must be yours to release. You must be able to prove it is your code, and you must provide an open source build to the owner, who will manually build your
   content for release. Obfuscated releases are reserved to staff only.

2. Credits are required where due. If someone is able to provide proof that you used their code without credit, you may be subject to having your release taken down, so please
   do your best to credit those who assisted you in your work.
   
3. Please submit your request with the following information:
   Owner - Your discord tag or whatever you'd like as your credit. Can be a youtube link or forum link, but you can only have one entry for this.
   Source Files - The files that will be released. Make sure to specify if you want it built into an exe or not for distribution by the owner.
   Credits - Any and all credits required for your submission
   Video (required) - A youtube showcase of your product. If you do not produce a video, your content will not be added into releases.
   Description - Any custom text you'd like to be pushed with your release.

Your content will be reviewed by the owner and you will get a response within 3-4 business days of your request.

We do not support closed source paid cheats from third parties at this moment in time.
